# My-Deep-Learning-Experience
My journey in deep learning: I look forward to a beautiful landscape and wish myself the strength to persevere, no matter how difficult it may be.
Thanks to Club JiZhi, Mr.Morvan, Mr.Songtian, Mr.Liaoyuan, and everyone who has helped me on my self-study journey. Thanks to the open-source world.
I'm on the way!
